format: html
jupyter: python3

In this exercise, you will practice basic operations in Jupyter notebooks, including writing and running Python code, working with Markdown cells, and performing simple data operations.

## 1. Setting Up the Notebook

1. Create a new notebook.
2. Rename it to `GroupX.ipynb` where `X` is your group number. 

Add some structure at the top cells:

```markdown
# Group Exercise 1

This notebook is for practicing basic operations in Jupyter notebooks. It includes examples of using Python code and Markdown cells to document the work.
```

Add a subsection with the name `Team` and underneath the subsection add a
bulleted list with the names of the team members.

Put the leader's name in bold.

Add a second subsection that contains a second bulleted list. Give the
subsection the title `Links` In this list add a
[link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#formatting-links) to a site
that each group member suggests as interesting to the class.

## 2. Basic Code Operations

In this section, you'll write and run some simple Python code.

```python
# Task 1: Print a welcome message
print("Welcome to JupyterHub!")
```

```python
# Task 2: Perform a simple arithmetic operation
10 * 3
```

```python
print(f'The value 10 * 3 is equal to {10 * 3}')
```

Run these cells, and explore what happens as you change some of the values.

Create some new code cells that extend on these ideas.

## 3. Working with Data

In this section, you'll work with a small dataset.

### Load and Display the Dataset

```python
data = [100, 20, 90, 40, 50, 30, 10]

# Display the dataset
data
```

### Perform a Basic Analysis

```python
# Task: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the dataset
sum(data)
```

```python
# Task: Calculate the mean of the numbers in the dataset
mean_value = sum(data) / len(data)
mean_value
```

How would you sort the data using python? Show your answer in a code cell.


As a group, come up with an answer to the questions:
Is the data skewed? If so, in what way?
Add Markdown cells that describe your reasoning used to come up with your answers.

## 4. Documenting the Analysis

Use Markdown cells to document your code and results. For example:

```markdown
## Dataset Analysis

We loaded a dataset containing the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 90, 100. Below is the sum and mean of these numbers.

With regard to skewness, we find ....
```

## 5. Final Touches and Submission

Review your notebook as a group. Ensure that it is well-organized and the code is properly documented.
Use the ability to [move cells around](intro.qmd#command-mode-running-cells) to reorganize as needed.


Once done, [save your notebook as a pdf](intro.qmd#saving-and-exporting).

Have the group leader turn the pdf in on [canvas](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/157862/assignments/1379443).
