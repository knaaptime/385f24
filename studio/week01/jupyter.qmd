title: "Studio   1: Working with Jupyter Notebooks on JupyterHub"
format: html
jupyter: python3
---


In this exercise, you will practice basic operations in Jupyter notebooks, including writing and running Python code, working with Markdown cells, and performing simple data operations.

## 1. Setting Up the Notebook

1. Create a new notebook.
2. Rename it to `GroupX.ipynb` where `X` is your group number. 

Add some structure at the top cells:

```markdown
# Group Exercise 1

This notebook is for practicing basic operations in Jupyter notebooks. It includes examples of using Python code and Markdown cells to document the work.
```

## 2. Basic Code Operations

In this section, you'll write and run some simple Python code.

```python
# Task 1: Print a welcome message
print("Welcome to JupyterHub!")
```

```python
# Task 2: Perform a simple arithmetic operation
10 * 3
```

## 3. Working with Data

In this section, you'll work with a small dataset. The dataset could be provided in different formats, such as a list of numbers or a CSV file.

### Load and Display the Dataset

```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70]

# Display the dataset
data
```

### Perform a Basic Analysis

```python
# Task: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the dataset
sum(data)
```

```python
# Task: Calculate the mean of the numbers in the dataset
mean_value = sum(data) / len(data)
mean_value
```

Is the data skewed? If so, in what way?


## 4. Documenting the Analysis

Use Markdown cells to document your code and results. For example:

```markdown
## Dataset Analysis

We loaded a dataset containing the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70. Below is the sum and mean of these numbers.

With regard to skewness, we find ....
```

## 5. Final Touches and Submission
In the top cell of the notebook, add a Markdown cell that lists all the group
participants (leader first).

Review your notebook as a group. Ensure that it is well-organized and the code is properly documented.
Use the ability to move cells around to reorganize as needed.


Once done, save your notebook and submit it as a pdf.

Have the group leader turn the pdf in on canvas.
