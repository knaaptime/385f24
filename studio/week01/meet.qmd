## Purpose
This handout provides instructions on how to use Google Meet for small group work, including creating a meeting, sharing screens (with sound off), and using the chat feature to collaborate on in-class studios.

## Getting Started with Google Meet

1. **Designating a Group Leader**
   - The instructor will designate a group leader for each group.
   - The group leader will be responsible for creating the Google Meet session.

2. **Creating a Google Meet Session**
   - The group leader should sign in to their Google account.
   - Go to [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com).
   - Click on the "New meeting" button and select "Start an instant meeting."
   - Once in the meeting, click on "Add others" to get the meeting link.
   - Copy the meeting link and share it with the other group members through email, chat, or any communication platform you are using.

3. **Joining the Google Meet Session**
   - Each group member should click the link provided by the group leader to join the session.
   - Allow Google Meet to access your microphone and camera if prompted.
   - Mute your microphone by clicking the microphone icon at the bottom of the screen to reduce background noise.

## Sharing Your Screen

Screen sharing helps all group members see the same content, making collaboration easier.

1. **How to Share Your Screen**
   - Once in the Google Meet, click on the "Present Now" button at the bottom right of the screen.
   - Select "Your Entire Screen" or "A Window," depending on what you want to share.
   - Click "Share" to start sharing your screen.

2. **Keeping Your Microphone Off**
   - Keep your microphone muted while sharing your screen to avoid feedback or echo. Use the chat for communication or unmute only when necessary.

## Using the Chat Feature

The chat feature is useful for collaboration without speaking out loud.

1. **Open the Chat**
   - Click on the chat icon (speech bubble) in the top right corner of the screen to open the chat window.

2. **Communicate Effectively**
   - Use the chat to ask questions, share links, and discuss the studio.
   - Keep your messages clear and concise to avoid misunderstandings.

## Best Practices for Google Meet Collaboration

- **Stay Muted When Not Speaking**: We will be in person, so no need to use your
  microphone in class.
- **Use the Chat to Communicate**: Share your thoughts and questions in the chat to maintain a smooth flow of discussion.
- **Keep Your Camera On**: This helps the group stay engaged and allows for
  better non-verbal communication. 
- **Be Respectful**: Listen to others, avoid interrupting, and provide constructive feedback.
- **Ensure Only One Person Shares at a Time**: This helps avoid confusion and keeps the focus on the task at hand.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Audio Issues**: If others cannot hear you, check that your microphone is not muted and that Google Meet is using the correct microphone in the settings.
- **Screen Sharing Problems**: Ensure that your browser has permission to share your screen.
- **Connectivity Issues**: If you experience lag or get disconnected, try refreshing your browser or checking your internet connection.

## Wrapping Up

At the end of the studio, the group leader should summarize the groupâ€™s
discussion and findings. The leader will hand in the summary on Canvas.

Happy collaborating!
