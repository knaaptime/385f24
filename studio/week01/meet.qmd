## Purpose
This handout provides instructions on how to use Google Meet for small group work, including creating a meeting, sharing screens (with sound off), and using the chat feature to collaborate on in-class studios.

## Find Your Team

Teams are randomly constructed. To find your team:

1. Visit the link for the team assignments for [Studio 1][S1].
2. The first person listed is the group leader. If the first person is not
   present, the first person next on the list who is present is the group leader
   for the studio.

## Getting Started with Google Meet


1. **Group Leader**
   - The group leader will be responsible for creating the Google Meet session.

2. **Creating a Google Meet Session**
   - The group leader should sign in to their Google account.
   - Using the Team Meeting link at the bottom of the [Studio 1][S1] Team
     listing, the Group Leader should start the meeting..

3. **Joining the Google Meet Session**
   - Each group member should click the link provided by the group leader to join the session.
   - Allow Google Meet to access your microphone and camera if prompted.
   - Mute your microphone by clicking the microphone icon at the bottom of the screen to reduce background noise.

## Sharing Your Screen

Screen sharing helps all group members see the same content, making collaboration easier.

1. **How to Share Your Screen**
   - Once in the Google Meet, click on the "Present Now" button at the bottom right of the screen.
   - Select "Your Entire Screen" or "A Window," depending on what you want to share.
   - Click "Share" to start sharing your screen.

2. **Keeping Your Microphone Off**
   - Keep your microphone muted while sharing your screen to avoid feedback or echo. Use the chat for communication or unmute only when necessary.

## Using the Chat Feature

The chat feature is useful for collaboration without speaking out loud.

1. **Open the Chat**
   - Click on the chat icon (speech bubble) in the top right corner of the screen to open the chat window.

2. **Communicate Effectively**
   - Use the chat to ask questions, share links, and discuss the studio.
   - Keep your messages clear and concise to avoid misunderstandings.

## Best Practices for Google Meet Collaboration

- **Stay Muted When Not Speaking**: We will be in person, so no need to use your
  microphone in class.
- **Use the Chat to Communicate**: Share your thoughts and questions in the chat to maintain a smooth flow of discussion.
- **Keep Your Camera On**: This helps the group stay engaged and allows for
  better non-verbal communication. 
- **Be Respectful**: Listen to others, avoid interrupting, and provide constructive feedback.
- **Ensure Only One Person Shares at a Time**: This helps avoid confusion and keeps the focus on the task at hand.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Audio Issues**: If others cannot hear you, check that your microphone is not muted and that Google Meet is using the correct microphone in the settings.
- **Screen Sharing Problems**: Ensure that your browser has permission to share your screen.
- **Connectivity Issues**: If you experience lag or get disconnected, try refreshing your browser or checking your internet connection.

## Wrapping Up

At the end of the studio, the group leader should summarize the groupâ€™s
discussion and findings. The leader will hand in the summary on Canvas.
